# 1- IMDB_INDIA_MOVIES

**Objectives**

I am very glad to make this project , this project help me to build up my coding skills and making my concept crystal clear.

I am very thankful to Codsoft to give such a beautiful projects. In all of those prjects i choosed Movie Rating Prediction because i go through all the columns & statements of the questions they asked in that, it attracted me very much to attempt this project.The primary objective of this project is to analyze the IMDb India Movies dataset to gain insights into the trends and characteristics of Indian cinema over the years. Key aspects of the analysis include exploring movie ratings, release years, genres, and identifying patterns that define the cinematic landscape in India.

Dataset: The IMDb India Movies dataset, obtained from the IMDb Datasets repository, includes information about Indian movies such as titles, release years, ratings, genres, and more.

Rows & Column:: There are total 15509 rows and 10 columns.

In Data collection:: I have found various columns with help of coding which are head(),tail(),describe(),info(),row(),column(). Some of the methods used & some column to be updated and changed here. Some columns has deleted due to duplicate column present in the list & many more things happened, you can easily go through my project.

Before visualizing any data from the Dataset we have done data Wrangling here. With the help of this we checked the null value of all the columns.After getting most null value in the columns, i dropped that columns by using "drop method".When we find minimal number of null values, filling those null values with necessary value as per as requirement by using .fillna()

# 2- IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION

**OBJECTIVES**

The Iris dataset is a widely recognized and classic dataset in the realm of machine learning. It contains data on three distinct species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Frequently utilized for tasks like classification, pattern recognition, and data visualization, this dataset serves as a common benchmark in the field.
The dataset contains the following attributes for each flower specimen:
1.Sepal length in centimeters

2.Sepal width in centimeters

3.Petal length in centimeters

4.Petal width in centimeters

These characteristics act as features that play a crucial role in distinguishing among the three Iris species. The Iris dataset is frequently employed as a foundational illustration when introducing key concepts like data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and classification algorithms in machine learning.
Based on these four features, the goal is to classify each flower into one of the three species. The dataset is balanced, meaning there is an equal number of samples for each species

# 3- Sales_Prediction

**Objectives**

Data Collection: A dataset (sales_data.csv) was created with columns such as 'Date,' 'Product,' 'Price,' 'Quantity,' and 'Sales.'

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the sales data into a pandas DataFrame.

Converted the 'Date' column to datetime format.

Extracted additional features like 'Month' and 'Day' from the 'Date' column.

Feature Engineering:

Selected relevant features for training the model, including 'Month,' 'Day,' 'Price,' and 'Quantity.'

Rows & Column:: There are total 200 rows and 04 columns.

In Data collection:: I have found various columns with help of coding which are head(),tail(),describe(),info(),row(),column(). Some of the methods used & some column to be updated and changed here. Some columns has deleted due to duplicate column present in the list & many more things happened, you can easily go through my project.
